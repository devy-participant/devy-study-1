# Devy Study Task 1

Devy is a prototype developer assistant that you can converse with to complete development tasks. To start a conversation,  prompt Devy by saying "Alexa, tell Devy..." or "Alexa, ask Devy...".

Complete the following tasks:
  1. First, simply launch Devy by saying "Alexa, launch Devy". This is just to make sure Devy is working (occasionally there are issues with wifi).
  2. Now, using Devy, try to get the name of the person whom you might contact to get help with making changes to this README.md file.
  3. Next, make sure you are on branch iss2 and then make a change to this README.md file (and save those changes).
  4. Finally, make those changes available on GitHub.

This task will likely be frustrating to complete since we haven't given you the commands Devy supports. However, the purpose of the question is not to complete the task but for us to understand what developers would say to get their work done. This information will be invaluable for creating more useful versions of Devy in the future. Note also that this prototype is trained to recognize a limited number of commands which also contributes to making this a hard task.
